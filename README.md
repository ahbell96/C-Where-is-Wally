# C++-Where-is-Wally

Creating a where is wally program, where i have a cluttered image and the reference image(wally). through the use of the reference image, i have to find or find the nearest to wally via the cluttered image.

to do this, I have do to the following:

I have created a matrix, which is passed rows and columns, (dimensions of the images).
i have created instances of the images.

I have to work out the sum of square difference, and then from that, when a score has been calculated, use NNS(nearest neighbour search) in order to find wally, or the nearest values close to wally.

Please feel free to look at my code and give me any advice and can help me improve it.

thanks
