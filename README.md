# C++-Where-is-Wally


SSD (Sum of Square Difference)
Within the SSD (Passing in two matrix's), Matrix1 (Wally image) and Matrix 2 (Cluttered Scene.).
I am wanting to find the difference of the two.
I have put them both within two for loops (matrix based off a 2D array), one loop for the Rows, one for the columns.
I then find the SSD Score, which is the difference times by itself. (D * D).
It is then pushed back into a vector, for the SSDscore is displayed within.

I am unsure if it is correct, or false, with the values that i am getting out, as they are quite large values, compared to those within the wally image and the cluttered image themselves.

I have a feeling that there is something wrong with the values that i am passing when finding the difference, but unsure.

any help would be appreciated!

thanks in advance
